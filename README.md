## Data Science

### [Who goes or stays?](https://github.com/toluwee/Customer-Churn)
Applied supervised machine learning techniques to predict the customers of a telecommunication company who are likely to churn. Insights from the analysis can inform the company on winning strategies for retention of high value customers.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data visualization
- Supervised machine learning
- Model tuning and evaluation

## Computer Vision

Created several image classification applications, which trains a deep learning model on a dataset of images and then uses the trained model to classify new images.

## Machine Learning Applications in Oil and Gas

### [How thick is this anyway?](https://github.com/toluwee/Rheology_prediction_with_blending_ensemble)
Applied supervised machine learning techniques to predict the apparent viscosity of nanoparticle stabilized CO2 foam for hydraulic fracturing. Blending, a variant of stacking ensemble learning technique explored as alternative for expensive laboratory experiments.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Ensemble learning technique
- Significant Variable identification using PCA and Permutation Feature importance
- Model tuning and evaluation

### [Where do you belong?](https://github.com/toluwee/Project-Segmentation)
Applied unsupervised learning techniques to organize global CO2 flooding projects into clusters. Those clusters were used to identify projects that share a similar set of reservoir and fluid parameters. Characteristics and performances of these analogous projects can be used to identify processes and decisions applicable to all. This will enhance operational and technical planning decisions in new or current CO2 flooding projects at field and well levels .

Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Project segmentation
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA
- Unsupervised clustering
- Model comparison

## Machine Learning Engineering with AWS EC2

### [Who gets in](https://github.com/toluwee/Who-gets-in)
I built a demo web page that a user can use to enter determine their chances of graduate school admission. The user inputs test scores and other metrics. The web page will then send the values off to the deployed XGBoost model, which will predict the probability of admittance. 

Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Supervised Learning
- Model deployment via AWS EC2
- APIs for web deployment
- Flask Web App
