## Data Science

### [Predicting Customer Churn for Telecommunication Company](https://github.com/toluwee/Customer-Churn)
Applied supervised machine learning techniques to predict the customers of a telecommunication company who are likely to churn. Insights from the analysis can inform the company on winning strategies for retention of high value customers.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data visualization
- Supervised clustering
- Model tuning and evaluation

## Computer Vision

Created several image classification applications, which trains a deep learning model on a dataset of images and then uses the trained model to classify new images.
